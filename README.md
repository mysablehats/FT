facerecognition docker container for ROS

This, turns out is mostly a fork of face_recognition (https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) with a few bits added to be able to run it from ROS. 

As we are currently employing it for face tracking, most of the features are underutilized, but still available and hopefully easy to deploy


## TODO:

- the package was copied from ageitgey instead of included with submodules. this should be fixed so that future improvements in main branch can be integrated

- should probably add face recognition integration with ROS
